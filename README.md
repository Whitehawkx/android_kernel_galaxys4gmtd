# Reset - v0.4.1 MTD

Welcome to the Reset of the Subtly Modified Stock kernel.

I started this project with the mindset of embedded linux, and at the bottom end of the android system learning curve.

Since then I've learned a lot about android and found a lot of my changes to understand what android expects may have been causing more problems then solutions.

The Reset kernel went all the way back to the initial Samsung T959VUVKJ6 source drop. Only adding on bits that worked.

More to come here...
